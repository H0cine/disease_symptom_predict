🩺 SymbiPredict - Disease Prediction System
SymbiPredict is a simple machine learning-based disease prediction system using user-input symptoms and a Random Forest Classifier. This project is implemented in Python and uses a dataset of symptoms to predict possible diseases.

📌 Features
Takes user-input symptoms via the command line.

Predicts the most likely disease using a trained Random Forest model.

Based on a dataset (symbipredict.csv) of symptoms and associated diseases.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

pandas(python libraries)

scikit-learn(python libraries)

🗂️ Dataset
The dataset used is symbipredict.csv, which contains multiple symptoms as features and a prognosis column as the target label
