🩺SymbiPredict - Disease Prediction System
SymbiPredict is a simple machine learning-based disease prediction system using user-input symptoms and a Random Forest Classifier. This project is implemented in Python and uses a dataset of symptoms to predict possible diseases.

📌 Features

Takes user-input symptoms via the command line.

Predicts the most likely disease using a trained Random Forest model.

Based on a dataset (symbipredict.csv) of symptoms and associated diseases.


🧠 Technologies Used

Python

pandas (Python library)

scikit-learn (Python library)


🗂️ Dataset
The dataset used is symbipredict.csv, which contains multiple symptoms as features and a prognosis column as the target label.
